# The-Bigger-Day
Mikey's Remix of The Big Day by Chance the Rapper

## Brief
This repo contains remixed songs from The Big Day, which combine with some original songs to form a **much** better album. The following sections explain how to import the audio files into a streaming service. I have successfully imported into Spotify on Desktop and iOS, but I believe it should be *even easier* on Apple Music and with AndroidOS. So the guide should cover the worst case scenario.

**This will take about 5m-15m to complete.** Based on how much better the album is after, I think it's more than worth it if you like Chance but never gave The Big Day much attention.

**The exact changes to the album are at the [bottom of this file](#detailed-explanation) (to avoid any spoilers for those who want to experience it through listening.**

## Spotify on Desktop
I found that the .m4a files are the highest audio quality files that work in this case (lossless compression). This is also the easiest way to listen to the remixed version of the album!

1. Download the M4A folder found on the top of this page
2. Open the Spotify application on Desktop
3. Click on your profile -> *Settings*
4. In the *Your Library* section, turn **on** *Show Local Files*
5. In the *Show songs from* section, select *Add a source*
6. Find the M4A folder you downloaded in *Step 1*

With the filepath to the M4A folder turned **on**, you should have a *Local Files* playlist located in your *Library*.

7. Add all 5 of the new songs in *Local Files* to a new playlist. I titled my new playlist *The Bigger Day* to differentiate it from the original album.
8. Organize the songs in the order specified at the [bottom of this page](#changes-in-the-remix) for what I consider the optimized listening experience :)

## Spotify on iOS
I found that the .m4a files will upload fine to the mobile version of Spotify, but for some reason the cover art doesn't transfer correctly. For this reason, I prefer the .mp3 versions of the songs (encoded at the max 320kbps rate). If you're an audiofile, you will of course hear the difference. But the average person, like myself, prefers to see pretty pictures better. I can **barely** notice that the sound is slightly more full with the .m4a files.

There are two ways to upload to the mobile version of Spotify:

### Sync with Desktop (easy if you already did the Desktop steps)
1. Complete steps 1-8 of the **Spotify on Desktop** version (substitute the M4A folder with the MP3 folder if you prefer the cover art over quality). The cover art may not show on Desktop if you choose .mp3, but it will show on mobile. It's weird.
2. Open Spotify on your mobile device and on desktop
3. On your mobile device, click on your profile -> *Settings*
4. Go to *Apps and devices*
5. Turn **on** *Local audio files*
6. Find your playlist (The Bigger Day) on both devices. It should automatically show on your mobile device if you're signed into the same account, the songs just won't be available.
7. Ensure both devices are connected to the same LAN. If you're not on a simple network at home (e.g. you're at work or school), connect the desktop to your mobile devices personal hostpot.
8. Click the download button for the playlist on both devices at the same time

This should make the songs available on the mobile device.

### Import to Mobile Device
1. Download the MP3 or the M4A folder on the top of this page onto the mobile device
2. On your mobile device, click on your profile -> *Settings*
3. Go to *Apps and devices*
4. Turn **on** *Local audio files*
5. In the *Files* app on the mobile device, locate the *Spotify* folder that should now be available
6. Move the 5 songs from the MP3 or M4A folder into the Spotify folder

The 5 remixed songs should now be available in the *Local Files* playlist in the Spotify app

7. Add all 5 of the new songs in *Local Files* to a new playlist. I titled my new playlist *The Bigger Day* to differentiate it from the original album.
8. Organize the songs in the order specified at the [bottom of this page](#changes-in-the-remix) for what I consider the optimized listening experience :)

## Other Streaming Services and Operating Systems
Good luck! You should be able to find plenty of information online, and my understanding is that it shouldn't be any harder than what I described above for Spotify, Desktop, and iOS.

## Changes in the Remix

### Spoiler-free tracklist (FYI when organizing)

2. *Eternal*
3. *Do You Remember*
4. *Handsome*

### Detailed Explanation
The new tracklist may be a little misleading, as I've combined some parts of songs together under one title. Here is a detailed description of what actually changed:

-Original Tracklist-
1. *All Day Long* **(Scrapped)**
2. *Do You Remember* **(Shortened)**
3. *Eternal*
4. *Hot Shower*
5. *We Go High* **(Merged w/ another song)**
6. *I Got You (Always and Forever)* **(Shortened and Merged)**
7. *Photo Ops (Skit)* **(Scrapped)**
8. *Roo* **(Scrapped)**
9. *The Big Day* **(Shortened and Merged)**
10. *Let's Go On The Run* **(Shortened)**
11. *Handsome*
12. *Big Fish*
13. *Ballin Flossing* **(Shortened and Merged)**
14. *4 Quarters In The Black* **(Scrapped)**
15. *5 Year Plan* **(Scrapped)**
16. *Get A Bag*
17. *Slide Around*
18. *Sun Come Down*
19. *Found A Good One (Single No More)* **(Shortened and Merged)**
20. *Town On The Hill* **(Scrapped)**
21. *Our House (Skit)* **(Scrapped)**
22. *Zanies and Fools* **(Shortened and Merged)**

-Remixed Tracklist-
1. *The Big Day* **(The Big Day, Ballin Flossin)**
2. *Eternal*
3. *Do You Remember* **(Shortened)**
4. *Handsome*
5. *Hot Shower*
6. *Get A Bag*
7. *Slide Around*
8. *I Got You* (**I Got You, Found A Good One)**
9. *Let's Go On The Run (Interlude)* **(Shortened)**
10. *Big Fish*
11. *Sun Come Down*
12. *We Go High* **(Zanies and Fools, We Go High)**

In total, I've kept **7/22 original tracks untouched**, **frankesteined 8 songs into 5 more concise songs**, and **completely scrapped 4 songs and 3 skits from the remix**. The runtime goes from 77m -> 47m.

I feel the general consensus of The Big Day is that it's a bunch of mid and cringe. The reason I remixed it is because I think it's truly some good mac n cheese surround by literal shit. Unlike an overall boring album, this one can be cleaned and polished. **With this remix, I truly believe it goes from one of the worst albums of all time -> being in conversation with 10 Day, Acid Rap, and Coloring Book.** I am no producer or sound engineer, so there are definitely parts I think could be done better with the "Frankensteining" of tracks. But overall I will be bumping this remix and wishing this is what dropped 6 years ago!
